# F1 Driver & Stats API Documentation

## Overview

This API provides access to Formula 1 data, including driver profiles, team information, race results, and analytical statistics. It is built with Django and Django REST Framework, featuring both a core data API and an analytics module.

**Base URL:** `https://itsaiight.pythonanywhere.com`

## 3. Authentication

The API uses a dual authentication system:

1.  **Public Access:** All `GET` requests are available without authentication.
2.  **Admin Access:** `POST`, `PUT`, `PATCH`, and `DELETE` requests require administrator privileges.

### How to Authenticate for Admin Actions

**Method 1: Token Authentication (Recommended for programmatic access)**

1.  Obtain a token via the endpoint: `POST /api-auth-token/`
    - **Body (form-data):** `username` & `password`
    - **Response:** `{ "token": "{{token}}" }`
2.  Use the token in the `Authorization` header for subsequent requests:
    `Authorization: Token {{token}}`

**Method 2: Session Authentication (Recommended for browsers)**

1.  Log in via the web interface: `GET /login/`
2.  Your browser will maintain a session cookie, granting you access to admin functions on the site and in the browsable API.

---

## 4. Web Interface & Navigation

The API includes user-friendly HTML pages for easy navigation.

- **Homepage (`/`)**: The main hub with links to the Admin Panel, Core API, and Analytics.
- **Analytics Home (`/analytics/`)**: A dedicated page with forms to quickly access driver stats and comparisons by entering driver names.
- **Browsable API:** Navigate to any API endpoint (e.g., `/core/drivers/`) in a web browser to use the interactive DRF browsable API, which allows you to explore and test endpoints easily.

---

## 5. Error Handling

Standard HTTP status codes are used.

- `200 OK`: Request was successful.
- `400 Bad Request`: The request was malformed (e.g., missing query parameters `a` or `b` for comparison).
- `404 Not Found`: The requested resource was not found (e.g., a driver with the provided name does not exist).
- `401 Unauthorized` / `403 Forbidden`: Trying to perform an admin action without valid credentials.

Errors typically return a JSON response with a descriptive message:

```json
{
  "error": "Please provide 'a' and 'b' query params"
}
```

---

## 6. Example Usage Scenarios

**1. Building a Driver Profile Page:**

1.  Fetch driver details: `GET /core/drivers/?full_name=Lewis Hamilton`
2.  Fetch their career stats: `GET /analytics/drivers/Lewis Hamilton/stats/`

**2. Creating a Head-to-Head Comparison Tool:**

1.  Use the comparison endpoint: `GET /analytics/comparison/?a=verstappen&b=leclerc`
2.  Display the returned wins, podiums, points, and head-to-head record.

**3. Populating a Database (Admin):**

1.  Obtain an auth token.
2.  Create a new team: `POST /core/teams/` with `{"name": "Aston Martin", "country": "UK"}`
3.  Create a new driver for that team: `POST /core/drivers/` with the driver's details and the team's ID.
